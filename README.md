In this Expo project, I utilized various components such as View, Text, ScrollView, TextInput, TouchableOpacity instead of the Button component, StyleSheet, SectionList, and Image to help me finish the project. As we know what these components are, I would like to discuss the reasons why I used TouchableOpacity instead of the Button component.

I chose to use TouchableOpacity because it allowed me to insert an image as the button's background. The Button component has a more limited set of customization options, and it can be challenging to achieve a consistent look and feel across platforms. In contrast, TouchableOpacity provides more flexibility in terms of the content and styling of the button, making it easier to create a custom button with an image background.

Additionally, TouchableOpacity is generally more performant than the Button component, as it uses the Animated API under the hood to handle the touch feedback animation, which is more efficient than the default button animations.

By using TouchableOpacity, I was able to create visually appealing and consistent buttons throughout my Expo app. Below are screenshots of the app, showcasing the custom buttons with image backgrounds that I implemented using TouchableOpacity
